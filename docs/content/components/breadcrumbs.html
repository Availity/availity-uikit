title: Breadcrumbs
ref: https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/breadcrumb/
description: |
  Breadcrumbs are links at the top of a page which indicate the relationship
  of the current page to the larger system page structure. While many
  browsers include 'Back' functionality to support a similar traversal, this
  functionality is not reliable as a result of form submissions or 'deep
  linking' - when users get to a lower-level page directly, without having
  visited it's parent pages. Breadcrumbs avoid these pitfalls by providing
  discrete links representing the intended hierarchy.
usage: |
  Typically, a breadcrumb should be used when viewing a page which is more
  than 1 level deep in a page hierarchy, and will then provide links back to
  each level of the hierarchy above it (e.g. Plants > Vegetables > Carrots).
  Top level pages (e.g. Plants) do not require breadcrumbs.
