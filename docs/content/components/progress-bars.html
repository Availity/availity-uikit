title: Progress Bar
description: |
  Progress bars convey to users a sense of status and give them a sense for
  how much is left in an activity.
usage: |
  Progress Bars can be used to convey live status for events such as file
  uploads and request processing, where a user initiates an action that's
  completed by the system. Additionally, progress bars can be used in some
  cases to convey the status of a user-driven, multi-step activity, such as
  registration.
notes: |
  Depending on how it's used, it may be appropriate to develop a separate
  pattern for use in wizards and other user-driven workflows.
