title: Alerts and Warnings
notes: |
  Use alerts and errors judiciously. While user errors - targeted messages
  derived from an action that was just taken - are almost always important,
  platform and payer status messages may not have the same user value.
  When users are constantly being shown status messages and alerts, each
  subsequent alert is decreased in value and users may begin to ignore them.
